## Project discription

The starter project file was used, which has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. This project was converted from a static project to an interactive one, primarily using javascript.  The navigation menu was added dynamically, and links will now smoothly scroll to the section selected.  The section at the top of the viewport is now highlighted using an active class in css.
